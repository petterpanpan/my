The [Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM)](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2018/) is an annual meeting of free and open source graphics software users and developers.

Held yearly since 2006, the LGM aims to attract developers, artists and professionals who use and improve free and open source software graphics applications.
The LGM aims to bring these people together in the cause of creating high quality free graphics applications.

LGM promotes discussions amongst software developers, users, and the large intersection of those two categories.
Unlike many events devoted to Free/Libre Open Source Software, LGM has always had a strong artistic focus, with designers and artists showcasing their work alongside the work of software developers.
