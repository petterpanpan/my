CopyTranslator is a free open source translation tool, which can help you process(e.g remove the extra line breaks when you copy from pdf) and translate the clipboard contents and display them in real time. It can also handle various demands for real-time translation. It has get more than 120 stars and more than 1k downloads on Github. 
But it's old logo is almost like the copy of the logo of Google translator, we can't use it any more, so we need a new logo. Here are our needs.
1. Original
2. Can reflect the core usage of the CopyTranslator, which is copy and translate.
3. Can be well displayed in the desktop environment.
