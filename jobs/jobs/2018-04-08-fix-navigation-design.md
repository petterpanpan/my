description: "Right now we have a pretty and very simple web site which describes our business processes.\r\nThe only thing that's not right is navigation bar.\r\n\r\nI really think that it is complicated and does not feel natural. And some users report that it is hard for them to figure out how to use it.\r\nBut, I can fix this by myself.\r\n\r\nWhat's required?\r\nWe need to create **simple** yet useful navigation bar, which won't take users attention from the content.\r\n\r\nWe also do not use anything except vanilla `javascript`.\r\n\r\nWe offer you to be mentioned in our `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file."
deliverables: "PDF/PSD/JPEG file with the mockup will be fine.\r\nOr you can send us a PR with the fix if you want to. https://github.com/wemake-services/meta"
