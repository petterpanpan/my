Hello,

I'm currently working on an OSS application for the GNOME Desktop for tracking daily steps & weight. It'd be great if we had symbolic (mono-colour) icons for the different settings categories (namely Steps, Weight and Sync (as in synching with other providers like Google Fit)). Here's how the settings-category-bar currently looks:

The icons should be in the same style as the one next to "General". See https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/SymbolicIcons for more info on symbolic icons.

The App also needs a main icon. I'm a bit unsure what direction to go here. Most other fitness providers seem to use a heart like Google Fit. The icons should follow the GNOME Icon Guidelines: https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/icons-and-artwork.html.en
