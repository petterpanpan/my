## About Outreachy

Participants of Outreachy work with an open source organization (in our case Discourse) on a 3 month programming project. Itâ€™s similar to events like [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), however the aim of Outreachy is to provide a collaborative environment in which newcomers from underrepresented backgrounds get an opportunity to learn from and contribute to FOSS by doing paid, full-time work.

> Participation is open internationally to all women (cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people. Additionally, it's open to residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.

Furthermore, unlike GSoC, Outreachy is open to all ages, not just students.

## About Discourse

Discourse is an open source forum platform: "Civilized discussion for your community". For a more in-depth description, see our [about page](https://www.discourse.org/about).
