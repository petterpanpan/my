title: Design an open source ecommerce platform (frontoffice / backoffice)
role: Web design
compensation: gratis
description: >-
  ventas is an open source ecommerce platform developed from scratch with a
  functional programming mindset. The main competitors would be Prestashop,
  WooCommerce and Shopify (just to give an idea of what we're aiming for). See
  the README for more information about the goals and the rationale.
deliverables: >-
  I can work with anything, but keep in mind I'm on Linux (so PSDs are probably
  not the best idea)
