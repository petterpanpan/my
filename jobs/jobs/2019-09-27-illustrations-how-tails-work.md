Tails, a portable operating system that protects your privacy and avoids
censorship, is looking for a design contractor to create illustrations
explaining Tails.

The contractor will create illustrations to aid in communicating:

- On the homepage: what is Tails and what are its main benefits

  6 small illustrations or icons, around 200px.

- On the 'How Tails works' page: the main properties and features of
  Tails

  10 medium-size illustrations, around 400px.

This work is part of a larger effort to improve the description and
explanation of Tails, adjust the voice and tone of the homepage, and
implement a newly developed brand identity.
