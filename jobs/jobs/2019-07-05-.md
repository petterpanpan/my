We have an existing logo that we love. It looks like this: 

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide/master/docs/_static/logo.png)

As you can see, it is in pretty low quality. 

Things we love about this logo:
- superman relation, some people call this project "linterman"

Things we are ok with changing:
- colors, they might be yellow and red, or the ones we use in a companies logo: http://wemake.services
- background color, it might be transparent and filled with any other color that suits it well

Things that are required to be changed:
- Quality and size
