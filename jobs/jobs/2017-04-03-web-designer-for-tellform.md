TellForm is an opensource, beautiful form builder that is similar to Typeform. We have over 10k unique visits per month and have been featured in BetaList, ProductHunt, HackerNews.

I'm looking for someone to help me redesign the admin panel. The last designer wstarted this but never finished and I feel like a good redesign could make TellForm even easier to use. I'm also interested in making a onboarding page similar to Slack's and Metabase's but that would depend on whether you would have time to do so.

I can't pay but I can send you some pretty sweet stickers!
