# Submissions for new logo

Bromite needs a new logo. The current logo is a derivation of [Chromium logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chromium_11_Logo.svg) and it makes sense since Bromite is 99% Chromium, but for the sake of the project it is better to have an original one.

This post will be updated with further information and precisations.

## How to submit your logo design

You can prepare a low resolution PNG (even watermarked) and submit it second these venues:
* by posting on the [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues/120), so that you can gather other users' feedback
* by sending it to [csagan5 via reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/csagan5); it will not be shared nor posted anywhere before or after the submission ends, except obviously if it is picked as the official logo of Bromite

## Inspiration material for this logo

Logo should obviously not look like Chromium logo, nor some other browser logo. A minimal design and the [current color](https://www.bromite.org/android-icon-192x192.png) would be great to have, but are not mandatory inclusion/exclusion factors for your submission.

For example the logo - in its most basic design - could be a greenish world with a test tube overlayed.

You can probably also play with the idea of chemicals, since [real-world bromite is the salt of an acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromous_acid). You can find more [information about these salts here](https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&lpg=PA91&dq=bromite&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q=bromite&f=false).

This information is mentioned mostly as a curiosity, since it is the most directly related to the name, but the design can completely ignore it; it is not considered an advantage in any way for the logo design (and it would be quite difficult to use regardless).

## Is there a monetary compensation for this work?

Yes, a donation of 100$ which can be transferred via PayPal.

This open source project has little budget (made up of donations), however the project has recently received a donation of 200$ from an anonymous donor and there is an allocated donation of 100$ for the creator of the picked logo.
The logo author and referral link will also be mentioned on the [project README on GitHub](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/blob/master/README.md).

## Is there a deadline for submissions?

No more submissions will be accepted after 5 October 23:59 UTC. If no logo has been picked yet, this might be extended, but it is unlikely.
