title: 'Need a modern day cartoon-esque banner! :)'
role: Logo / banner
compensation: gratis
deliverables: "If someone could replace the sylenium banner currently on github i would be very appreciative.  \r\nI would really like a cartoon theme and the logo (feather with or orange background) is no longer what I want, the actual log should be a super hero called $y (with that on his chest, like superman) and he should be almost like inspector gadget, technology and in particular automation."

  - "current banner can be seen here: https://github.com/symonk/sylenium/blob/master/.github/.images/sylenium2.png\r\n"

Sylenium needs some updated art! Would be highly appreciate if you could help out! 
Sylenium is an open source test automation framework written in java for web application test automation.

I will buy you a beer and put your portfolio/personal link on the project landing page! :)

Thanks again
