The current avatar of the [WIP app](https://github.com/apps/wip) was meant as a placeholder. Now that itâ€™s quite popular it would be nice if we could create a proper logo for it. 

I am not good at this :D But I thought maybe we could manage to make some kind of combination of a 
ðŸ¤– robot head and the letters WIP that create a face

![wip logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39992/39668305-dcd41256-507e-11e8-89a7-9395b2c92abb.png)

But hey Iâ€™m open to suggestions.

Iâ€™ll give full credit for the logo in the repositoryâ€™s README and would also donate $50 in your honour to [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) or similar initiatives.
