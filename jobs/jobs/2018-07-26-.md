Tab Wrangler is a browser extension that automatically closes tabs you haven't used in a while so you can focus on the ones that matter.

Tab Wrangler needs better branding. It has happy and engaged users, but the logo and messaging doesn't build confidence in the professionalism of the extension. New branding would make the extension more visible in the Firefox and Chrome stores.

The extension is entirely open source, and the developers do not make any money from it (there's no advertising, no tracking, no user data stored at all).
