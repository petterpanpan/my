It would be awesome if someone would draw our current logo in better quality with transparency. Our logo is very cute octopus.  If you're love octopuses then contact me.

Mimesis is a fast and easy to use library for Python programming language, which helps generate mock (dummy) data for a variety of purposes  in a variety of languages. This data can be particularly useful during software development and testing. The library was written with the use of tools from the standard Python library, and therefore, it does not have any side dependencies.
