LibreLingo is an experiment to create a community-driven language-learning platform. We are looking for a mascot for this project.

We are thinking about a tortoise

> Tortoises are common symbols of wisdom across multiple cultures, and it emphasizes that learning languages is a slow and steady process. Maybe the shell's pattern could consist of characters from various scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Ge'ez, etc.).

Something fun like octocat's design should be awesome
