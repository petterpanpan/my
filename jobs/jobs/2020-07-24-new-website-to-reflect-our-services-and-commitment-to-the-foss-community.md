Fosshost is a provider of free cloud hosting services to the free and open source software community.  We advocate and promote the use of linux operating systems and software to more than 30 open source projects, which allows projects to be able to flourish and grow, without funding (or no funding at all) expensive hosting bills.  We remove the worry many projects often have of when "free credits" will expire by giving projects a permanent home for all of their hosting and development needs.  We are an inclusive project that sits firmly within the foss community and we believe in sharing our resources for common goals. Our community is global and we are in more than four countries which allows us to provide reach to projects in the USA, UK and Europe.

Fosshost是一家为免费开源软件社区提供免费云托管服务的提供商。我们在30多个开源项目中倡导和推广linux操作系统和软件的使用，这使得项目能够蓬勃发展，无需资金（或根本没有资金）昂贵的托管费用。我们消除了许多项目经常担心“免费积分”将到期时，给予项目一个永久的家，以满足其所有托管和开发需要。我们是一个包容各方的项目，在自由和开放源码软件社区中站稳脚跟，我们相信为了共同的目标共享我们的资源。我们的社区是全球性的，我们在四个以上的国家，这使我们能够提供到美国，英国和欧洲的项目。
