Kiwi IRC is a modern web IRC client built with Node.js and Vue.

The new incarnation of Kiwi IRC is starting to be pretty solid: [https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient)

The lead developer Darren aka prawnsalad could use a hand with the interface presentation and layout.

I believe with this modern web client approach we can get rid of the image of IRC as a clunky and opaque interaction tool. Having the power of server-side makes all sorts of magical things possible (storage, data processing etc.). The ideal would be to GUIfy everything, so the non-techy user will not have to face any frightening /commands. I guess the hardest will be inventing a GUI for even the ChanServ commands like setting various flags for channels.

Perhaps the first step would be conducting a competitive analysis of new and emerging chat platforms.

Listing open source ones:

* [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/)
* [Zulip](https://zulip.org/)
* [Rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat/)
* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/)
* [Let's Chat](https://sdelements.github.io/lets-chat/)
* [Riot](https://riot.im/)

Here is a quick route to Kiwi IRCâ€™s channel using the WIP new client: [https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.freenode.net/kiwiirc](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.freenode.net/kiwiirc)
