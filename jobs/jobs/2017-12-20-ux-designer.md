As a UX Designer at Moodle, you'll contribute to making Moodle the world's most effective platform for learning.

You'll have a significant role in improving the usability of software currently used by millions of people worldwide. As an advocate for the end user, you'll conduct research into user behaviour and be the expert in understanding our users' goals, needs, and pain points.

You'll play an essential role in a newly restructured Open Source development team providing day-to-day design support to the team, and be part of a much bigger international community of contributing developers and Moodle Partners.

What your new job can look like… Most days can involve a mix of:

Designing tools and features for both beginners and advanced Moodle users.

Demonstrating deep user empathy and effectively share user experience sensibilities with team members.

Working iteratively to solve complex business and technical problems through sketching, diagraming, wireframing and rapid prototyping.

Conducting frequent user research and usability testing and gather data to inform your design decisions.

Collaborating closely with developers, team leads, and other designers to ensure goals and deadlines are met.

...and having a laugh with your team...

We'd love to meet you… Especially if you can talk to us about your:

Design portfolio with relevant projects across various channels including web and mobile.

Strong understanding of design principles including colour, layout, and typography.

Knowledge of industry best practices and established design pattern libraries.

Experience with evidence-based design thinking.

Excellent time management and communication skills.

Enthusiastic and approachable personality.

Ability to work independently and take initiative but also be a team player.

Excellent communication skills (both written and verbal).

What's in it for you?

Besides the obvious that we've mentioned - a workplace where we really value our peers, and a caring, respectful, open and innovative workplace - what about:

A competitive salary.

Gaining new skills by learning from highly skilled peers.

Regular social events.

Flexible workplace including no dress code.

Monthly massages.

The knowledge you are helping millions of people reach their goals worldwide.

Does this all sound good? If yes…

Add a cover letter, resume, a link to your portfolio and anything else you'd like to share.

Press send.

The successful candidate does not need to be based in Perth, remote workers will be considered.

Candidates sent by recruitment agencies will not be accepted.
