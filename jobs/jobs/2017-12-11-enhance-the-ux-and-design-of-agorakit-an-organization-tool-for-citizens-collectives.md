Agorakit is web-based, open source groupware for citizens. 
By creating collaborative groups, people can discuss topics, organize events, store files and keep everyone updated as needed. 
Agorakit is a forum, calendar, file manager, mapping tool and email notifier.

The current user interface is based on Bootstrap 3 (with Laravel on the server). I, the main dev, and our thousands of users around the world would really benefit from your experience in user interface design and usability.
