I'm currently working on making a project of mine, Cluxia, a bit more public. At the moment it consists only of public chat services (XMPP) but it will eventually provide free email, social network, git hosting etc.

What I would want is a logo that we can use for the project, possibly alongside a color palette and font. The logo would be used on the website, but also as an avatar for the project on various services.

"Cluxia" is originally the combination of "clusia" (a tree, somewhat neutral?) with the "x" of XMPP. A current draft of what I want to publish on cluxia.eu is linked alongside this post and may help to get a picture of our target.
