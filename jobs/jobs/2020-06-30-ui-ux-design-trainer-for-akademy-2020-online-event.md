Each year during Akademy we have training sessions that help our open source community grow their skills.

During a recent poll, one of the most requested training topics was "UI/UX design for developers". For that reason, we're looking for a trainer that could conduct a training session on this topic for Akademy 2020 in September.
We're looking for a person that has experience in conducting professional trainings and is qualified in the topic. This yearâ€™s Akademy will be completely online, so access to proper equipment for streaming the session is expected.
Familiarity with KDE or open source  is not required but definitely a plus.
