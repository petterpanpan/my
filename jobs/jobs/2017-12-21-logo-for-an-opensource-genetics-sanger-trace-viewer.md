CutePeaks is a cross plateform Sanger Trace viewer wihch allow biologist to view DNA sequence. 
We are a small community of french developers and we want to make free and opensource genomics software. 
4peaks is a non-opensource alternative, you can see the logo.
 It would be greate to have a logo which display trace data or dna somewhere.
