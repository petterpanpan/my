The Yocto Project is developing a web interface to the OpenEmbedded build system, to make it fit for humans. The web interface is called Toaster (we have a cooking theme going on). We need a favicon for the web interface. We are open to anything design-wise: go nuts! <a href="http://www.yoctoproject.org/toaster">We have a design prototype</a> you can check to get an idea of what Toaster does.
