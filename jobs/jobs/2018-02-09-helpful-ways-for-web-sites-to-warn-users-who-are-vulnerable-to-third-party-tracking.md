  tracking

description: "Aloodo is a fake third-party tracker designed to help webmasters get their users protected from real third-party trackers.\r\n\r\nInclude the Aloodo script on your site and it will generate JavaScript events when it detects that it can track the same browser from one site to another. \r\n\r\nDesign help is needed in presenting tracking warnings to the user in a way that will best help and encourage them to take action and get protected, without being confused for an ad, scam, or malware."
