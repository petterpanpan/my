_AntennaPod is a podcast manager and player for Android. Contrary to many of its competitors, it is open source (MIT License), developed and translated by volunteers, gratis and ad-free._

The appâ€™s current main developer is currently working on **AntennaPod version 2**, an important update with lots of bug fixes and UI improvements. To honour this major step, we are looking for a **new logo and app icon** and simple colour palette. Other contribution most welcome as well. The goal of the new design is to help give AntennaPod a modern and professional look.

The AntennaPod lead developer ByteHamster & long-standing active community member Keunes will be involved in the process. Together they developed the [design brief](https://antennapod.org/designbrief) - check it out if you're interested!
