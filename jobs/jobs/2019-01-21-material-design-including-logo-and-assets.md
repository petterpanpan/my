The project is to convert the blood donation flow to push based, where the donors register in our app and set a base location. If any request posted near them for blood or platelets, they will get a push notification to which they can respond. 
This is open source, free forever, ad-free, no revenue expected project.
I am the only person working on it now. Using Angular, Angular material, and Firebase.
Need logo, assets, UX design using material standards for this PWA. This is responsive and should scale to all devices.
