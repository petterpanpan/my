Very simple: go to app.gitmate.io, set up a repository, set up code analysis.

Alternatively visit the mockups here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4fltUySwFR7ZksxbGVVWGZuajA

Tell us what we can do better at coala.io/gitmate

We are developing the new version of the prototype you just tried at https://gitlab.com/gitmate/gitmate-2/
