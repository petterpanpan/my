Thunderbird, the desktop Email client used by 26 million users, is working to revamp our website and we're looking for a passionate web designer to help make the website look and feel more modern and improve the experience of using the website for our users.

You can check out our website at [Thunderbird.net](https://thunderbird.net). It is a good website, but could use improvements to draw attention to the points we'd like to (such as donate and download). We are also planning on adding a get involved page and would like a talented person to help guide the design of that page.

We're looking for a talented designer to help us come up with designs that we can then work to implement. Preferably this person would be good with CSS and HTML, but we can help take any work they produce and incorporate it into the website. If you'd like to take a look at the source code of the site you can [find it here](https://github.com/thundernest/thunderbird-website).
