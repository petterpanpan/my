description: "SReview is an AGPLv3-licensed video review system for conferences. It was originally written for FOSDEM 2017, and has been reused for DebConf17 and FOSDEM 2018. If you were a speaker at any of those conferences, you may have seen it in action.\r\n\r\nThe idea of SReview is that reviewing hundreds of videos takes an insane amount of time if it needs to be done by the video team; but if you can crowdsource the review to the actual speakers who spoke at the conference (and possibly other volunteers), it can happen in much less time. However, for that to be successful, the review page needs to be as easy as possible to use; otherwise speakers either give up or enter the wrong data, and the resulting videos are not as good as they can be. The current UX is as easy as I can make it; but I'm not an expert on the subject and would welcome a review and/or redesign of the review page by someone who is.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few technical limitations to the system that reviewers may need to be aware of and which are not so obvious at first glance; unfortunately, some speakers have misunderstood the way the system works, and released videos with incorrect data as a result. This should absolutely be remedied to the full possible extent."
