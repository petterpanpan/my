Mocha is a testing framework, and [the most depended-upon project](https://libraries.io/search?order=desc&platforms=NPM&sort=dependents_count) in the npm ecosystem. 

...but our site was built in (literally) 2011.  That said, this old horse gets about 200k page hits a month over the past year (it's a single page).

Our site should still be focused on documentation (tutorials and dry API docs), but would also like to add a "news" or "blog" section.  Let's move away from "one huge page" and organize it properly.  The site should be responsive, accessible and lightweight.

A new logo and/or logotype would be desirable. Our tagline is "simple, flexible, fun"; ultimately the design of the logo and site should reflect that.  We plan to put the logo(s) on shirts, stickers, and swag.

Donations the project has received could pay for the work.  We are all volunteers, but we don't have enough time nor skill to pull this off ourselves.  You *can* do this for free, but we want you to be motivated!
