Kedro is a Python development framework that implements software engineering best-practice to help data engineers and data scientists develop data pipelines and machine learning models that are production-ready.

We are primarily trying to improve the usability and adoption of Kedro but also have some work to do on how it integrates and scale with other solutions within our product suite.

This role is part of QuantumBlack Labs, the innovation and product engineering group of QuantumBlack building softwares that facilitate, accelerate and enable the development and deployment of AI/Machine Learning solutions at scale in production.
