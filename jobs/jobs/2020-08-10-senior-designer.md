Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Senior Designer will contribute their creative energy to a passionate team of open source hacktivists. You will be responsible for capturing user insights and creating a collage of imaginative ideas which can be realised through agile collaboration with a team of technical superstars. You will ignite HOT’s dynamic community of digital humanitarians by understanding the needs of a diverse group of staff, stakeholders, volunteers, contributors and users in order to inspire user flow and delight as we map an area home to one billion people.

You will work closely with the Director of Technology and Innovation and the Senior Technical Lead to support the entire team with User Experience and Product Design projects. You will lead and mentor the creative growth of our team and contribute to a culture of open sourced, human centered and inclusive technologies that inspire humanitarian action.

You’ll be involved in every aspect of our product development process, from early concept, to wireframe, to prototype/mockup, to pixel perfect design, build, and launch. Since we are a small team, you’ll also have your hand in directing and prioritizing the product roadmap. In this role, you’ll be responsible for owning the user experience across HOT’s existing and future projects.
