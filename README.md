We are Samho Creative Studio, a global community of creative professionals. We provide avenues of collaboration and opportunities for people working in all creative fields (photography, video production, graphic design, development, product, consulting design, copywriting, etc.).
We offer project matching services ~ all for free!

We're an open creative work community!

We gather creative and innovative talents from all walks of life to integrate creativity and art into life services, to create a place spirit with human warmth, to promote good relationships between people, and to unite and connect innovative brands across borders to carry out valuable exploration and practice of new lifestyles.
Open community platforms are indeed important, but more important is to stimulate the vitality of an area, which requires innovation, connection, the talent in the community, the brains of the talent, the collision and connection between these smart brains!

Looking to improve your professional expertise while getting paid?

Looking forward to growing up with friends who share your vision?

Our mission: to build a network of cultural and creative cooperation and exchange platforms, promote the construction of a new business service model and value conversion, so that good creativity really serves people's production and life, and truly realize the mission vision of creativity to make life better!

The mountains have no edges and heaven and earth are united, outstanding and untouched by dust!

We don't lack standard methods and systems for evaluating workload, but we also believe that if both parties work together based on a relationship of trust, you are entitled to be paid what you think is fair based on the value you provide, so that motivation can be incentivized. That is, of course, if the rest of the team believes that your compensation is also reasonable.
